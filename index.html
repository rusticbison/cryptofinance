							I'll be shameless with my age: twenty years ago things were a lot different. You had plastic disks that stored your music, and there were portable versions but if you moved too much the music would "skip".

							If you wanted to learn about something, you had to go to where the knowledge was stored: the library.

							This of course was very expensive. We don't usually think in these terms, but it's important to consider just what it took to perform a simple information search in 1996.

						<h2>Information in 1996</h2>

							In case you've never seen a book before, I have a picture for you. You had to carry these things around campus with you! (Maybe you still do!). They're heavy, hard to share (you have to be right next to the person you want to share with) and easy to lose. It also takes time to leaf through the pages to find the information you're looking for.

							This is not a knock against books per se- I just want to make it clear that this was the only option at the time, and that slowed things down quite a bit.

						What is HTTP? Well first it is an initialism, a subcategory of an abbreviation. But what we mean when we say Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is connectivity as we know it today. WhatsApp, iMessage, Wikipedia, Facebook.
					</aside>
						<h2>HTTP Happens</h2>
						<p>A social revolution got underway: anyone with a computer could exchange information instantly, reliably and at negligible cost.</p>

				<section data-transition="convex" id="paper">
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's look at how simple communication was handled before HTTP. We still use paper mail as a novelty, but otherwise business uses electronic communications. It may not seem like much, but the global impact is huge.
					</aside>
					<h2>This is how you communicated before HTTP</h2>
					<p>Wait 3-5 days at a price of about $0.32 USD</p>

				<section data-transition="convex" id="aim">
					<aside class="notes">
						We take this for granted today, but "instant messaging" was a major innovation and changed our social dynamics. Instead of calling someone and risking talking to the wrong person (this was before cell phones, remember) you could type them a message. This was also less formal than calling, and made it easier to create relationships. Now there are more complex social tools, Facebook was just the beginning. Now we have specific communities that help us communicate to a very specific audience (like Strava, or Tinder).
					</aside>
					<h2>This is how you communicated after HTTP</h2>
					<p>This takes less than 1 second and costs ~$0.00 USD</p>

						So we looked at some of the things we used to do and reflected on their comical inefficiencies; communicate with paper, ask people for directions, call the place where a person lives instead of calling the person, and so on. But now is the time to look in the mirror, and see what silly things we are doing today that people in the future will laugh at. We keep score in life, we use rectangles of cotton and plastic, and with little metal disks. The same thing people did a thousand years ago.

					<p>More than <i>two billion</i> people have difficulty engaging in modern business (banking and e-commerce) today.</p>

				<section data-transition="convex" id="issues">
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's look at physical coins and cash. You can't "instant message" it. Just like books it's pretty difficult to access and move. It affects people's behavior - you can physically overpower someone and take their rectangles and disks. This means it's dangerous to keep this stuff around.

						One really cool thing about cryptofinance is that there are so many really intelligent people involved. The point here is that people are organizing themselves in different ways to solve difficult problems and create new services, whether it's a traditional company like Monetas or a community driven project like Bitcoin. Let's look at a few case studies where some of these services are being applied.
